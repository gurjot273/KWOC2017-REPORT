<h1> KWOC â€“ END TERM REPORT <h1/>
  
<p>KWOC helped me get started in open source development which seemed a herculean task for a beginner like
  me.I am really thankful to KWOC for providing such an opportunity. </p>
  
<h2> #STRUGGLE IN THE BEGINNING
  
   <p>I started participating in KWOC ON 2 December,2017. I watched a video on github regarding the workflow of git and github to get familiar with them.I created my own
repository,cloned it to my local computer, added some commits and pushed them to my repository. </p>
  <p> I had a tough time chosing the project as I was only familiar with C language by then. As I was really 
interested in maths, I chose the project "SYMPY" dealing with symbolic maths in python under mentor 
Shivam Vats thinking that I would be able to contribute to it. So I took a couple of days to learn PYTHON. 
I was able to grab the basics and so I tried to address the issues. But I could not understand the existing 
code because of unfamiliarity with python libraries. It seemed to me as if they were using many library 
functions in a single line of code. Also the Mathematics was above the scope of a first year maths course. </p> <h2/>

<h2> #FIRST PULL REQUEST 
  
  <p> I finally found the right repository "SMVDU ALGOS" under mentor "Sushil Khanchi" to where I could contribute.
It was a collection of implementations of algorithms to contribute to. By then I had a knowledge about very 
few algorithms one of them being binary search.
I messaged my mentor and asked him where I could contribute. He told me to go through the easy issues and try
to solve them.
There was an issue regarding no "binary_search" implemetaton in C. I submitted a pull request to be merged with 
master branch. My mentor found some flaws in my code and accordingly commented. I thought and I made the 
necessary changes and commited them. I asked my mentor to review it again and finally my pull request was finally
merged. It was a great feeling to see my code as a part of the master branch. </p> </h2>

 <h2> #MID TERM EVALUATION 
  
  <p> I had to work hard to get my pull requests merged before 15th December 2017. Finally I passed the midterm 
 evaluation. When I saw the leaderboard with my name on it along with no. of pull requests and commits, I
 was very happy. Then I decided to learn new algorithms and write their implementations. </p> </h2>

<h2> #SKILLS LEARNT <h2/>
  
  <p>I learnt to program in C++ and python which I did by converting my implementation written in C to C++ and python with the 
help of internet. Soon I was able to submit implementations for algorithms in python. </p>
   <p>I also learnt various sorting algorithms like gnome_sort,radix_sort,counting_sort etc and search algorithms like
interpolation search. I learnt a great deal by looking at the code of other users including my mentor especially
conversion of recursion to dynamic programming. </p>
   <p>I also learnt that it takes a great deal of patience to become a good open source developer and learnt the review
process in github for maintainance of work.It also helped me become a  better programmer by writing efficient code with the 
help of algorithms.  </p>
 <p>I ended submitting pull requests by 31st December,2017 because of the end of the coding period.  </p>
